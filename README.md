# HeartbeatOpenScrip-Unity
This is an Experiment made with Unity (not endorsed), that talks about how do we able to simulate heartbeat sound on a living based on beating section (i.e. Systole and Diastole, in this planet and other Original characters that inherits this principle).

## Why?
It was an approach to reach bored cardiophille (who like heart to its beats), that was disappointed for something that has been lacking over the past few years, where there can be only so many same format emphasize. Perkedel in the other hand, wants to deeply have cool and good interaction of it. unfortunately, only few games that actually emphasize cardiophille, and they are really expensive. Perkedel hates proprietarism, hates expensivism, and hates partialism. There is none hope for Cardiophille Emphasized game that is Free, open source, and full version.

So Perkedel has to make their own.

## HeartbeatOpenScript.cs
We made it a simple. You can put BPM. let the GameObject be controlled for this component like e.g. change heart rate.

### Systole and Diastole Arrays
These arrays are where you will put sound cluster in it. each set represents heart valve clap. By default, human has 2 Systole AudioClips (Pulmonary and Aortal clap close (Blood In)) and 2 Diastole AudioClips (Tricuspid & Mitral clap close (Blood out)). Sometimes, e.g. on amphibian, they do have 3 chamber (Systole size 1, Diastole size 2). Sometimes some species may have more or less. Hope you get it.

## Free, Open Source, Full Version
We want everyone enjoy this. We cannot stand for those proprietarist expect monetary fund that wouldn't be guaranteed even perfect, or even good. 
not just that, We wish you guys can fetish around without any restriction possible. that's how do we doing good based on our mission from God.

## Imperfection
Any question, troubles, ideas, etc.? You can place Issue and tell us your ideas and what should we talk about.
You are free to fork this. GNU GPL v3! Perkedel has right to pull request back your contribution and accept or reject the pull request made.
Audio is also not included! You will need to provide your own heartbeat audio. can be pseudo heartbeat (just Systole contains 1 lub dub) or best is to get meticulous (spliced heartbeat audio, separating Systole set and Diastole set).

## Thank you for your attention
Yeah. that was cool. and good.
Duper Awesome!!!
